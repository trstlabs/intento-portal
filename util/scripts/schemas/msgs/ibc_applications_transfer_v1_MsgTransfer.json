However some consensus algorithms may choose to reset the height in certain conditions e.g. hard forks, state-machine breaking changes In these cases, the RevisionNumber is incremented so that height continues to be monitonically increasing even as the RevisionHeight gets reset Please note that json tags for generated Go code are overridden to explicitly exclude the omitempty jsontag. This enforces the Go json marshaller to always emit zero values for both revision_number and revision_height."
